# Projects

Also, have a look at the things I've built myself:

## SfontPlayer

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/sfontplayer)

A MIDI / SoundFont player. It's built on top of [RustySynth](https://github.com/sinshu/rustysynth), but uses a custom sequencer that supports features like seeking.

## SoundFont Compiler

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/soundfont-compiler)

A command line tool for building SoundFont 2 files with a workflow that resembles software development. Just a janky proof of concept, but it works.

## Titomachine

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/titomachine)

A project that explores emulation and inner workings of a computer. I built this during and after the computer organization course at university. This was my first Rust program and I didn't have much experience in general, so the codebase is pretty rotten.

## NESMachine

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/nesmachine)

I ripped out the core from titomachine and replaced it with 8-bit nintendo hardware. Now being rewritten from scratch.

## yykaakoo-lemmy

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/yykaakoo-lemmy)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d67dc9e2-8b3f-4737-965f-eb5d5756e888" height="400" />

I decided to explore building a web app. Social media client.

## WorldEdit

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/worldedit)

An unfinished spline-based terrain generator for Godot game engine.

## NMH Viewer

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/nmh-godot)

A 3D model viewer & archive explorer for No More Heroes games. The games use custom asset formats that I reverse-engineered myself, except for the RSL archive format.

## SR2 Chonker

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/sr2_chonker)

A chunk (open world piece) viewer for Saints Row 2. The game uses custom asset formats that I reverse-engineered myself. I originally got interested upon learning that Volition, the game studio, had documented some of their file formats for players mess with. Unfortunately it seemed that no one there wanted to touch the chunk format, as it's a massive blob with dependencies in other files, loaded by a complex rube goldberg machine in multiple passes. They got rid of the format in later games.

## mgs4mdn-blender-import

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/mgs4mdn-blender-import)

My first model tool. A Blender import addon for Metal Gear Solid 4 .mdn files. The game uses custom asset formats that someone else had reverse-engineered before me.

## Visual Timer

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/visualtimer)

I made an Android app with flutter. I was going to publish it on Play Store, but gave up when I realized I had spent more time navigating Google's hoops for developer accounts than developing the app itself.

## Misc

Just less important things that I may not have the source code for anymore. Screenshots without code aren't great proof of skill, but I wanted have show these at least somewhere.
