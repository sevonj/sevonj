# Projects

Also, have a look at the things I've built myself:

## SfontPlayer

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/sfontplayer)

A MIDI / SoundFont player. It's built on top of [RustySynth](https://github.com/sinshu/rustysynth), but uses a custom sequencer that supports features like seeking.

## SoundFont Compiler

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/soundfont-compiler)

A command line tool for building SoundFont 2 files with a workflow that resembles software development. Just a janky proof of concept, but it works.

## Titomachine

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/titomachine)

A project that explores emulation and inner workings of a computer. I built this during and after the computer organization course at university.

## NESMachine

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/nesmachine)

I ripped out the core from titomachine and replaced it with 8-bit nintendo hardware. It passes a couple test roms I threw at it, but doesn't boot real games, which is probably because I didn't implement CPU interrupts.

## Visual Timer

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/visualtimer)

I made an Android app with flutter. I was going to publish it on Play Store, but gave up because navigating Google's hoops for developer accounts and publishing felt more time consuming than developing the app itself.

## WorldEdit

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/worldedit)

An unfinished spline-based terrain generator for Godot game engine.

## NMH Viewer

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/nmh-godot)

A 3D model viewer & archive explorer for No More Heroes games. The games use custom asset formats that I reverse-engineered myself, except for the RSL archive format.

## SR2 Chonker

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/sr2_chonker)

A chunk file (open world piece) viewer for Saints Row 2. The game uses custom asset formats that I reverse-engineered myself. I originally got interested after learning the game studio spent real developer time documenting their file formats for players mess with. Unfortunately no one there seemed to know or even want to touch the massive, complex rube goldberg machine that makes up the open world in this game.

## mgs4mdn-blender-import

[➜ Go to repository](https://github.com/sevonj/mgs4mdn-blender-import)

My first model tool. A Blender import addon for Metal Gear Solid 4 .mdn files. The game uses custom asset formats that someone else had reverse-engineered before me.
